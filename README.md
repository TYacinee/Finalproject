READ ME : EVA 

●  ABOUT THE PROJECT 
This project is the result of a close collaboration with the team 
behind Chasingball, a dedicated community of Rocket League players. 
By granting access to their extensive dataset, Chasingball has 
enabled the creation of EVA, a specialized data coach. While I am 
responsible for the development of the coaching intelligence, the 
Chasingball team provides the essential infrastructure to gather and 
update information from their database. As Chasingball is a free 
service where any player can link their account, EVA is specifically 
designed to serve those integrated into this ecosystem, only players 
that are in the database can use the coach. 

●  ABOUT THE WEB PLATEFORM 
The project is hosted on a dedicated website that serves as more 
than just a tool; it is a complete hub for understanding the 
project’s vision. Visitors can explore the motivations driving the 
development, access detailed data visualizations, and most 
importantly, interact with the Data Coach interface. The platform 
acts as the bridge between raw game logs and meaningful performance 
analysis. 

● ABOUT EVA 
Accessing EVA’s expertise is a straightforward process designed for 
the players. Once on the website, a user needs to go to the EVA 
page, then he simply enters their player name to retrieve their full 
match history stored in the database. After selecting a specific 
game, EVA processes the information to generate custom visuals and 
statistical insights. Beyond static charts, users can engage in a 
direct conversation with EVA to discuss their performance and 
receive tailored advice. 
● ABOUT THE FUNCTIONING OF EVA 
EVA’s intelligence is built on a sophisticated hybrid architecture. 
At her core lies a combination of predictive and explainable models. 
While the predictive model determines outcomes, the explainable 
model identifies the specific data points that led to those 
conclusions, ensuring that every piece of advice is grounded in 
logic. To make this information accessible, EVA utilizes the OpenAI 
API to power her conversational abilities. This allows her to act as 
a decision-maker and coach, though her logic remains strictly 
tethered to the actual data retrieved from the player's matches. 

● ABOUT THE HOLE PROJECT 
The broader scope of this project is documented through a series of 
comprehensive notebooks. These documents track the entire evolution 
of the project, including data manipulation, model development, and 
the iterative training of EVA. While these technical resources are 
not part of the public-facing website, they are maintained in a 
GitHub repository to showcase the project's advancement and the 
rigorous data science behind the final product.
